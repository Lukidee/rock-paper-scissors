# rock-paper-scissors
Image manipulation with a cyclic cellular automaton

Each pixel (cell) plays rock/paper/scissors with a random neighboring pixel based on which of the RGB channels is dominant. Red beats green, green beats blue, blue beats red.
The winning pixel overtakes the loser. Various blending controls have been added.
